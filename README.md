# CSE2ICE

This project is about the finished stories about assignment CSE2ICE.

The intention of ICE is to prepare you for industry as a junior web developer. 
We have covered fundamental and topical material in this subject to aid you in this endeavour.
The employment market for graduate level front-end developers is strong, however entry is very selective. 
To this end, we have designed an assignment to give you experience on current industry relevant technologies and to assess you based on expectations a prospective employer would have. In this assignment,
you will have to prepare yourself for a quantity of self-directed study and experimentation. As front-end development is such a fast-moving area, the ability to research and implement current and emerging technologies is critical. At the conclusion of this assessment item, 
we hope you will be proud of your product and will cite it in future job applications.
